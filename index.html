      <h3>Hello.</h3>
      <p>My name is Eduard and I want to becomne a Web Developer.</p>
      <p>I have discovered programming a few years back and since than that is all I wanted to do, but between wishing and doing is a huge gap.</p>
      <p>Following that path I have tried different programming languages to see what suits me the best.</p>
      <p>I have always tried to learn more and grow so I have did a number of courses like :</p>

      <p>
        <button class="btn btn-primary" type="button" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#collapseExample" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="collapseExample">
          Fundamentals of Java Programming
        </button>
      </p>
      <div class="collapse" id="collapseExample">
        <p>The course was done at <a href="https://www.infoacademy.net/">InfoAcademy</a>, it took twelve weeks to complete and to create a phone agenda.</p>
        <p>It was my first interaction with a programming language and it was hard at first, but than I managed to understand it.</p>
        <p>What got me into this course was the promise for a automation position, sadly it never happened.</p>
      </div>

      <button class="btn btn-primary" type="button" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#collapseExample" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="collapseExample">
        Fundamentals of Swift Programming
      </button>
      </p>
      <div class="collapse" id="collapseExample">
        <p>The course was done at <a href="https://www.telacad.ro/">Telecom Academy</a>, it took twelve weeks to complete and to create a phone agenda.</p>
        <p>This was the second programming course I took, so it was easyer to get into it.</p>
        <p>Swift has a special place in my heart, but without owning a mac it was hard to sharp my skills and I could not found a position for it.</p>
      </div>
